# sequence-generator
The second project in Vanilla Projects course is a counter, with buttons to increase, decrease or reset the counter.
So I created an arithmetic sequence generator that allows a user enter an initial number as well as an increment value.
The user can then go ahead to generate numbers that follow that progression.
A user can also reduce the size of the sequence or reset the entire thing to enter new numbers and generate a new sequence.
